Changes
* CMOR now supports Python 3.6 and 3.7.
* PrePARE will stop if CMIP6_coordinate.json, CMIP6_formula_terms.json, and CMIP6_CV.json are missing from the table directory.
* Changed missing value replacement history message to include "corresponding data".
* The UUID library ossuuid has been replaced with libuuid
* CMOR will now use the json-c library installed from conda-forge instead of building its own library.
* In the Python API, CMOR will throw an error if the number of time steps being passed to `cmor.write` is less than `ntimes_passed`.
* If the number of timesteps written is less than the length of the time axis, CMOR will give a warning when closing.
* cdms2 has been replaced with Netcdf4 for use in PrePARE.

Bugfixes
* Fixed bug in PrePARE where it crashes when it does not find the `_FillValue` attribute in a file.
* Fixed error caused by variables having both a singleton dimension and a generic level.
* Fixed bugs in PrePARE where it was not processing the attribute `cell_measures` correctly.
* Fixed bug caused by `cmor.write` in the Python API when the number of time steps passed is less than the `ntimes_passed` argument.
* Fixed bug when handling the `olevhalf` dimension.
* Fixed error caused by variables having multiple singleton dimensions.
* Fixed bug when using CMOR in Append mode for instantaneous variables.
* Fixed bug caused by multiple instances of CMOR running a file permissions test by writing a test file.  Each test file will now have the instance's PID in the file name.
* Fixed bug where the frequency of the variable used in the last call to cmor_write is applied to the output file name of all variables when calling `cmor_close_variable` or `cmor_close`.
