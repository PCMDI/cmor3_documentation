Features
* CMOR automatically sets attributes in a dataset using the registered data listed in a project CV's source_id entry (e.g. `Tables/CMIP6_CVs.json` or `Tables/input4MIPs.json`), reducing the input requirements from a user. This feature can be overridden by setting the attributes in the user input file (e.g. `user_input.json`).
* Added ability to write `reftime` and `leadtime` coordinates to datasets for forecast data.

Changes
* End of support for Python 3.6.
* CMOR now supports Python 3.10.
* The CCLRC license has been replaced with a BSD-3 license.
* Replaced retired listserv email address with pcmdi-cmip@llnl.gov.
* Updated CMOR and CF versions listed in the Fortran wrapper.

Bugfixes
* PrePARE would crash if the `experiment_id` attribute is not present in a dataset.  It will now check for the presence of `experiment_id` before further processing the dataset.
* PrePARE was generating errors when processing `cell_methods` values that contained multiple comments, which are substrings in parentheses embeded in the values.  PrePARE can now handle `cell_methods` values containg mulitple comments.
* Fixed error caused by an error message exceeding the maximum string size when an attribute value cannot be validated with a list of values from the CV.
* Corrected typo in udunits initialization message.
