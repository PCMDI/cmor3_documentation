Features
* The global attributes `realization_index`, `initialization_index`, `physics_index` and `forcing_index` can now have string values when either `_use_strings_for_indexes` or `_cmip7_option` are present in the user input parameters.

Bugfixes
* Resolved an issue where running multiple unit tests within a unittest class that used variable tables with branding suffixes would corrupt the branding suffixes, labels, and out names in subsequent tests.

Changes
* Added support for Python 3.14.
* [PrePARE](/mydoc_cmip6_validator){:target="_blank"} has been removed from CMOR.
* CMIP7 tests have been updated to confirm that secondary realms can be applied to variables by having multiple realms listed for `modeling_realm` in variable entries. See test [here](https://github.com/PCMDI/cmor/blob/7cb35817ac1672496d30605ac7f6e920407bc471/Test/test_cmor_CMIP7.py#L142-L197){:target="_blank"}.
