Accelerate PrePARE from 2s to 0.1 (IPSL request). Fix PrePARE/CMOR memory issue.  Call Cdunif.so library directly instead of cdms2.  Rremove fixed double array to dynamic double due to number of objects increasing.  *Update license REGEX  to allow "/" at the end of URL (GFDL request).  * Update "Conventions" REGEX to allow "CMIP-6.0" up to "CMIP-6.2".  Update grid tables.  Remove standard_name to vertices_latitudes and vertices_longitudes for CF-1 compliance.
