Features
* Added the functions ``cmor_set_quantize`` and ``cmor_set_zstandard`` for exposing the data quantization and Zstandard compression utilities of the netCDF library since version 4.9.0.
* MacOS arm64 builds for use on Apple silicon (M-series CPUs).

Bugfixes
* The attribute `realm` will not be written to files if it is not specified in the `required_global_attributes` of a controlled vocabulary.

Changes
* Compatibility with the Numpy 2.0 C API.
* Use netCDF's default chunking rather than setting chunk size to 1 for coordinates/axis such as `time` to enhance performance of reading netCDF variables.
