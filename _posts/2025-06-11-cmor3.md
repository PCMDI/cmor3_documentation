Update CMOR3 with CF CRS container variable; Numerous edge case fixes, license reformulation for CMIP7

Features
* Added the function `cmor_set_crs` used for creating a CF Coordinate Reference System (CRS) container variable.
* The `license` attribute can now be generated from a template in the CV file. It requires the user to provide a `license_id` in their input JSON, which determines what license type and URL will be used when generating the license string. The attributes `license_id`, `license_type`, and `license_url` are not included in the global attributes of a file unless they are listed in the CV's `required_global_attributes` list.

Bugfixes
* Removed erroneous warning message that says zero time steps were written for a time axis if `cmor_write` was used to write all time steps without setting the ntimes_passed parameter.
* Invalid JSON in user input or tables will be caught and throw an error instead of silently causing segmentation faults.

Changes
* Time axis intervals will now be checked when passing time values with `cmor_write`.
* To use zstandard compression, the user must disable deflation with `cmor_set_deflate` and then provide a valid zstandard compression level within the range [-131072, 22] using `cmor_set_zstandard`. Performing only one of the two actions will result in no zstandard compression being applied.
* `cmor_write` will throw an error if variable or zfactor data contains NaN values.
* Calendars in the CF 1.12 release that are not supported by CMOR (i.e `utc`, `tai`, `all_leap`, and `366_day`) will throw an error message asking users to use another, more common calendar.
* `cmor_time_varying_grid_coordinate` has been deprecated, and will be removed in a future release.
