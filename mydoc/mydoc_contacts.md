[cmor@lists.llnl.gov](mailto:cmor@lists.llnl.gov)

1. To subscribe to the `CMOR` mailing list, 
   
   * send an email writing `subscribe cmor` in the text of your message to [LISTSERV@listserv.llnl.gov](mailto:LISTSERV@listserv.llnl.gov)

1. To learn how to use the `LISTSERV` email application, go to [https://www.lsoft.com/resources/manuals.asp](https://www.lsoft.com/resources/manuals.asp)


1. The following email addresses are used for the specified purposes:

    * To send an email to the list: [CMOR@LISTS.LLNL.GOV](LISTS.LLNL.GOV)

    * To contact the list owner: [CMOR-request@LISTSERV.LLNL.GOV](mailto:CMOR-request@LISTSERV.LLNL.GOV)

    * To send commands to the `LISTSERV` server: [LISTSERV@LISTSERV.LLNL.GOV](mailto:LISTSERV@LISTSERV.LLNL.GOV)

    * To unsubscribe from the list: [CMOR-signoff-request@LISTSERV.LLNL.GOV](mailto:CMOR-signoff-request@LISTSERV.LLNL.GOV)
 

1. INTERACTING WITH LISTSERV BY EMAIL *

    * You may leave the list at any time by sending a `SIGNOFF CMOR` command (include `SIGNOFF CMOR` in the email body to: [LISTSERV@LISTSERV.LLNL.GOV](mailto:LISTSERV@LISTSERV.LLNL.GOV))

    * Or by sending a blank email to: [CMOR-signoff-request@LISTSERV.LLNL.GOV](mailto:CMOR-signoff-request@LISTSERV.LLNL.GOV)

    * You can also tell `LISTSERV` how you want it to confirm the receipt of messages that you send to the list. To send yourself a copy of your own messages, send a `SET CMOR REPRO` command.

    * Alternatively, to have `LISTSERV` send you a short acknowledgement instead of the entire message, send a `SET CMOR ACK NOREPRO` command. Finally, you can turn off acknowledgements completely with the `SET CMOR NOACK NOREPRO` command.

    * This list is available in digest form. If you wish to receive the digested version of the postings, then issue a `SET CMOR DIGEST` command.

    * Please note that it is presently possible for other people to determine that you are signed up to the list using the REVIEW command, which returns the email address and name of all the subscribers (include `Review CMOR` in the email body) to:  [LISTSERV@LISTSERV.LLNL.GOV](mailto:LISTSERV@LISTSERV.LLNL.GOV)

    * If you do not want your name to be visible, then just issue a `SET CMOR CONCEAL` command.

    * Following instructions from the list owner, your subscription options have been set to `"REPRO IETFHDR`" rather than the usual `LISTSERV` defaults. For more information about subscription options, send a `QUERY CMOR` command to [LISTSERV@LISTSERV.LLNL.GOV](mailto:LISTSERV@LISTSERV.LLNL.GOV).
