### Acknowledgements

Several individuals have supported the development of the CMOR1 software and provided encouragement, including Dean Williams, Dave Bader, and Peter Gleckler.  
Jonathan Gregory, Jim Boyle, and Bob Drach all provided valuable suggestions on how to simplify or in other ways improve the design of this software, and we particularly appreciate the time they spent reading and thinking about this problem.  
Jim Boyle additionally helped in a number of other ways, including porting CMOR to various platforms.  
Brian Eaton provided his usual careful and thoughtful responses to questions about CF compliance. 

Finally, we appreciate the encouragement expressed by the WGCM for developing CMOR.
 
The complete rewrite of CMOR, along with the new capabilities added to version 2, was implemented by Charles Doutriaux.  

We thank Dean Williams, Bob Drach, Renata McCoy, Jim Boyle, and the British Atmospheric Data Center (BADC). 

We also thank every one of the "early" adopters of CMOR2 who patiently helped us test and debug CMOR2. 

In particular we would like to thank Jamie Kettleborough from the UK Metoffice, Stephen Pascoe of the British Atmospheric Data Centre, Joerg Wegner of Zentrum für Marine und Atmosphärische Wissenschaften, Yana Malysheva of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and Alejandro Bodas-Salcedo of UK Metoffice for the many lines of codes, bug fixes, and sample tests they sent our way.
